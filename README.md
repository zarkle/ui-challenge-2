CF 301 UI Challenge 2

Custom Form Elements Using Sprites

In 3 hours, build a series of custom form elements, some of which will require the use of a provided sprite-sheet.

Requirements:
- Good HTML structures
- Use HTML and CSS only. No JavaScript is needed. (Instructions on comp design are outdated so ignore them.)
- Style the page to reflect the comp image provided as closely as possible.
- Position the Sprite sheet with CSS, probably taking advantage of background images and top/side positioning. 
- This only needs mobile view, not desktop.
- Limit yourself to 3 hours. There are no absolute right or wrong answers... just do your best.
